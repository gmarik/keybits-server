Keybits is a project to make it simple to run your own personal server. We use **Docker** and **Ansible** to run carefully chosen applications in containers that are easy to install and update.

You can read more about the project on the `main project website <http://keybits.net>`_ and `blog <http://blog.keybits.net>`_.

Sign up for the `free newsletter <http://keybits.net>`_ on the Keybits website to get occasional emails when we add new features or apply security updates.
